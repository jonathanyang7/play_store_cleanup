## Reflection

This one-week project aimed to reinforce my advanced SQL skills acquired through [Mode](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial), and apply the PowerBI training I at received PwC. The primary goal was to develop a dashboard for the internal 'Adventure Works' team to monitor and analyse their annual revenue.

The end-to-end data project provided a valuable learning experiences. The initial days I spent exploring the data, understanding table nuances, and conducting exploratory data analysis were particularly beneficial in solidifying my comfort with SQL.

My initial view on next steps are to conduct a detailed analysis of the reseller segment of Adventure Works, considering its recent poor financial performance. My initial hypothesis for why this is the case is high costs. I think this could be because of greater shipping costs (to resellers and customers) and/or the additive commission paid to resellers for intermediating the sales process. I would investigate and analyse the typical reseller cost structure to test this.
